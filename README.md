# 🧃 The Intellectual Resume of Amay Jain

Welcome to the digital resume of **Amay Jain** —
where brilliance meets bizarre, and logic occasionally takes a lunch break.

This is not a *job-winning*, *corporate-pleasing* portfolio.
This is a shrine to the one man who could argue with Google... and win.

## 🤔 What’s Going On Here?

This is a **fun project**. A fake resume.
A tribute to Amay’s legendary brain, baby-faced charm, and possibly his snack addiction.

No resumes were harmed in the making of this site.
Well… maybe his real one.

## 🧠 Built With Big Brain Energy

* 📄 HTML – for the bones
* 🚫 JS – because minimalism is cool (and we got lazy)

## 💡 Why?

Because **Amay Jain** deserves a corner of the internet that matches his vibe:
Smart. Quirky. Unbothered.
This site = 20% effort, 80% personality, 100% Amay.

## 👨‍🔬 Creator Notes

Crafted by Uddhav Matholia,
because normal resumes are too mainstream for **The Amay Experience™**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a joke site. Nothing here should be used to evaluate Amay Jain professionally.
Unless you're impressed. In which case... carry on. 👀
